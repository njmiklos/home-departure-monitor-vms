# home-departure-monitor-vms
The idea is to create Raspberry Pi–powered home display that shows the next departures for selected public transport stops in the VMS ([Verkehrsverbund Mittelsachsen](https://www.vms.de/)) region. The monitor should render a departure-board style view of planned and actual departures of nearby stops.
